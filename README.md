1. Use the scripts in “Development Kit Lab 3” to generate input data, load
data and save results. Refer to the ReadMe file for details on how to use
them.

2. Time measurement should be implemented.

3. The number of threads should be passed as the only command line argument
to your program.

4. Optimize the performance of your implementation as much as possible using
the techniques learned in class.

5. You don’t need to consider the singular cases, i.e., a linear system with
no solution or an infinite number of solutions. The input data generated
by “datagen.c” will avoid such cases. You do need to include the partial
pivoting procedure in your code to make the computed results correct and
numerically stable.
